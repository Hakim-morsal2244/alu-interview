# Rain

This project solves the "Rain" problem: given a list of non-negative integers representing walls in a cross-sectional view, it calculates how many units of water will be retained after it rains.

## Requirements

- Language: Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- Style: PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)
- No external modules allowed
- All files must be executable
- All modules and functions must be documented

## Usage

To run the test file:

```bash
./0_main.py

Example
For walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4], the program will return:
